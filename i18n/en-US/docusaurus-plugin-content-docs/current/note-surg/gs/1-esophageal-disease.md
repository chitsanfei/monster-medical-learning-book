# Esophageal Diseases

## Overview

### Definition

- **Definition**: A muscular tubular organ located between the pharynx and stomach, slightly flattened front and back.
- **Segments**: Upper, middle, and lower.

### Development, Structure, and Function

- **Adult Length**: 25 cm.
- **Narrowest Part of the Digestive Tract**.
- **Development**: Differentiation of a portion of the primitive digestive tract from the caudal end of the primitive pharynx -> Increases in length along with the development of the neck and chest -> Initially lined with a single layer of epithelium -> Overgrowth and even closure -> By 8 weeks, apoptosis and regression of the overgrown epithelium, esophageal epithelium becomes stratified -> Surrounding mesenchyme differentiates into the connective tissue and muscular layers of the esophageal wall.
- **Upper End**: At the level of C6, connecting with the lower part of the pharynx -> Descends between the vertebral bodies and trachea -> Passes through the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm at T10 -> Lower end at T11, connecting with the gastric cardia.
- **Segments**:
  - **Cervical Segment**: From the beginning of the esophagus to the plane of the sternal notch.
  - **Thoracic Segment**: From the plane of the sternal notch to the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm: Longest segment.
  - **Abdominal Segment**: From the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm to the gastric cardia: Shortest segment.
  > Clinically, the segments are also classified using the lower margin of the azygos vein arch and the lower margin of the pulmonary artery as landmarks.
- **Three Narrow Points**:
  - **At the Beginning of the Esophagus**: 15 cm from the central incisor.
  - **Where the Esophagus Crosses the Left Main Bronchus**: 25 cm from the central incisor.
  - **Where the Esophagus Passes Through the Esophageal Hiatus of the Diaphragm**: 40 cm from the central incisor.
- **Histology**: Typically four layers: (outer) mucosa, submucosa, muscularis, and adventitia (inner).

## Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

### Overview

- **Definition**: Reflux of stomach and duodenal contents into the esophagus causing adverse symptoms or complications. Abbreviated as GERD.

### Classification

- **Based on Endoscopic Findings**:
  - **RE (Reflux Esophagitis)**: Presence of erosions or ulcers.
  - **NERD (Non-Erosive Reflux Disease)**: No erosions visible under endoscopy.

### Etiology

- **Weakened Esophageal Anti-Reflux Defense**:
  - Weakened esophageal clearance capacity.
  - Reduced barrier function of the esophageal mucosa.
- **Attack of Reflux Material on the Esophageal Mucosa**.
> **Anti-Reflux Barrier Components**: Lower esophageal sphincter (LES), diaphragmatic legs, esophagogastric ligament, sharp angle between the esophagus and the fundus of the stomach (Angle of His).
>
> **Cause of GERD**: Primarily dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a disorder of esophageal motility.

### Pathology
- **RE (Reflux Esophagitis)**: See endoscopic findings below.
- **NERD**: Basal cell hyperplasia, elongation of lamina propria papillae, vascular proliferation, inflammatory cell infiltration, widening of squamous cell spaces. "Inflammation + Hyperplasia + Widened Squamous Cell Spaces".
