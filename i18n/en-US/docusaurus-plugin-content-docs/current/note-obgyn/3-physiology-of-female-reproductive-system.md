# Physiology of the Female Reproductive System

## Ovarian Function and Cyclical Changes

### Ovarian Cycle

- Definition: The Ovarian Cycle refers to the periodic changes in form and function of the ovaries, occurring from puberty until menopause.
- Three Phases:
  - Follicular Phase (Proliferative Phase).
  - Ovulation.
  - Luteal Phase.

> The corresponding changes in the endometrium are as follows:
> - Menstrual Phase: The period when the endometrium sheds and is expelled through the vagina, typically lasting 3-7 days. During this time, the functional layer of the endometrium sheds due to a decline in hormone levels, resulting in menstrual bleeding.
> - Proliferative Phase: Immediately following the menstrual phase, also known as the follicular phase. As the ovaries secrete estrogen, the endometrium thickens, with cells rapidly dividing and multiplying to prepare for potential fertilized egg implantation. This phase generally starts on day 6 of the menstrual cycle and continues until ovulation.
> - Secretory Phase: This period, from ovulation until the start of the next menstrual cycle, is also called the luteal phase. Here, the corpus luteum secretes progesterone, making the endometrium even thicker and richer in nutrients, providing a suitable environment for fertilized egg implantation and early embryonic development. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates, progesterone levels drop, and the endometrium begins to degrade, leading into the next menstrual cycle.
> 
> Note: Although not directly mirroring each other, the endometrial and ovarian cycles are coordinated. The menstrual and proliferative phases of the endometrium align with the follicular phase of the ovary, while the secretory phase of the endometrium following ovulation corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovary.

## 卵巢功能及周期性变化

### 卵巢周期

- def：卵巢周期（Ovarian Cycle）：从青春期开始到绝境前，卵巢在形态和功能上发生周期性变化。
- 三期:
  - 卵泡期（增生期）。
  - 排卵期。
  - 黄体期。
> 子宫内膜的时期变化如下：
> - 月经期：子宫内膜脱落并通过阴道排出的时期，通常持续3-7天。此期间，子宫内膜的功能层因激素水平下降而脱落，形成月经出血。 
> - 增生期：紧接着月经期之后，这段时期又称为卵泡期。随着卵巢分泌雌激素，子宫内膜开始增厚，细胞迅速分裂和增殖，为潜在的受精卵着床做准备。增生期一般从月经周期的第6天开始，持续到排卵前。 
> - 分泌期：这是从排卵后到下一个月经周期开始的时期，又称为黄体期。在此期间，黄体分泌孕激素，使子宫内膜变得更加肥厚和分泌营养物质，为受精卵的着床和早期发育提供适宜的环境。如果没有受精发生，黄体退化，孕激素水平下降，子宫内膜开始退化，进入下一个月经周期。
> 
> 注意：子宫内膜和卵巢周期非一一对应但协同变化，（子宫内膜的）月经期 + 增生期 = （卵巢的）卵泡期，排卵期过后的（子宫内膜的）分泌期对应（卵巢的）黄体期。
