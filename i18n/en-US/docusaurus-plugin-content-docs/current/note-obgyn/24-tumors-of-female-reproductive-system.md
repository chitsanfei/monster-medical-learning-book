# Female Reproductive System Tumors

## Cervical Cancer

### Overview

- **Definition**: Malignant tumor originating in the cervix.

### Etiology

> Similar to cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion.

- **HPV Infection**.
- **Sexual Behavior and Number of Deliveries**.
- **Others**: Such as smoking.

### Histopathology

- **SIL** continues to develop, breaking through the **basement membrane beneath the epithelium**, infiltrating the stroma, forming invasive cancer.

### Pathological Types

- **Invasive Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Common type, accounting for 75-80%.
  - **Macroscopic Types (4)**:
    - **Exophytic Type**: Most common, cauliflower-like, often involving the vagina.
    - **Endophytic Type**: Infiltrates deep tissues, cervix appears smooth, enlarged, hard, and barrel-shaped.
    - **Ulcerative Type**: Combination of the above two types, forming ulcers or cavities, resembling a volcanic crater.
    - **Cervical Canal Type**: Originates within the cervical canal, often invading the blood vessels of the cervical canal and isthmus and metastasizing to pelvic lymph nodes.
  - **Microscopic Types (2)**:
    - **Microinvasive Squamous Cell Carcinoma**.
    - **Invasive Squamous Cell Carcinoma**. (Differentiated from high-grade to low-grade or using keratinized versus non-keratinized criteria)
- **Adenocarcinoma**:
  - **Macroscopic Types (2)**:
    - **Ordinary Cervical Adenocarcinoma**: The most common histological subtype of adenocarcinoma, 90%, occasionally showing interstitial mucinous pools but no explicit mucin in tumor cells, cytoplasm is amphophilic or acidophilic.

## Leiomyomas of the Uterus

### Overview

- Common benign tumor composed of smooth muscle and connective tissue.

### Etiology

- Unknown, local high sensitivity of leiomyoma tissue to estrogen + progesterone promotes differentiation suggesting a link.
- Genetic studies of leiomyomas have confirmed some abnormalities.

### Leiomyoma Degeneration

- **Glassy**: Most common, myocytes disappear, uniform transparent area without structure.
- **Cystic**: Inner wall lacks epithelial coverage.
- **Red**: Special necrosis during pregnancy or puerperium.
- **Sarcomatous**: Rare.
- **Calcareous**: Layered deposition seen microscopically in calcified areas.

> Glass table, red dress, eating naan with meat, drinking AD calcium milk.

### Treatment

- **Observation**: No treatment if asymptomatic.
- **Medication**:
  - Mild symptoms in women nearing menopause, follow-up every 3-6 months.
  - **GnRH-a (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog)**: High-dose continuous or long-term non-pulsatile administration.
  - **Mifepristone**: Antagonizes progesterone, not suitable for long-term use, risk of endometrial cancer.
- **Surgery**:
  - **Indications**: Menorrhagia caused by leiomyomas, infertility due to leiomyomas, severe abdominal pain, compression, suspected sarcomatous change.
  - **Myomectomy**: Possibility of recurrence, preserves fertility.
  - **Hysterectomy**: Suspected malignancy, no need to preserve fertility.

## Endometrial Cancer

### Overview

- **Definition**: Epithelial malignant tumor arising in the endometrium.
- **Endometrial adenocarcinoma** is the most common.

### Etiology

- **Type I**: Estrogen-dependent: **Obesity, hypertension, diabetes, infertility, delayed menopause, anovulatory diseases**.
- **Type II**: Non-estrogen-dependent: Unclear.

> Type I: High sugar, fat, women, endless.

### Clinical Presentation

- **Vaginal Bleeding**: 90%, in premenopausal women, increased menstrual flow, prolonged menstrual periods, and menstrual irregularity.

### Diagnosis

- **Medical History**.
- **Diagnostic Curettage**: Routine choice for vaginal bleeding, segmental curettage to exclude endometrial cancer.

## Ovarian Tumors

### Histological Classification

- **Epithelial Tumors**: Most common, divided into **serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell, transitional cell (Brenner tumor), mixed seromucinous**.
- **Germ Cell Tumors**: Derived from germ cells, divided into **teratomas, dysgerminomas, yolk sac tumors, embryonal carcinomas, non-gestational choriocarcinomas, mixed germ cell tumors**.
- **Sex Cord-Stromal Cell Tumors**: Derived from sex cords and mesenchymal tissue of the primitive gonads, divided into **pure stromal tumors, pure sex cord tumors, mixed sex cord-stromal tumors**.
- **Metastatic Tumors**.

### Staging

- **Stage I**: Limited to the ovary or fallopian tube.
- **Stage II**: Tumor involves one or both ovaries with pelvic spread.
- **Stage III**: Accompanied by histologically confirmed extra-abdominal metastasis.
- **Stage IV**: Metastasis beyond the abdomen.

### Ovarian Epithelial Tumors

#### Overview

#### Treatment

- **Common Chemotherapy Regimen**: Paclitaxel, Carboplatin.
