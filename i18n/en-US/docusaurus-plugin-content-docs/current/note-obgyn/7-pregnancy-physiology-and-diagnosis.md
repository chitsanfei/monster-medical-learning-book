# Physiology and Diagnosis of Pregnancy

## Physiology of Pregnancy

- **Pregnancy**: The process of embryo growth within the mother's body.
- **Start of Pregnancy**: Fertilization of a mature ovum.
- **End of Pregnancy**: Expulsion of the fetus and its associated structures from the mother's body.

## Fertilization

- **Definition**: A capacitated sperm fuses with a secondary oocyte, occurring in the ampullary-isthmic junction of the fallopian tube: fertilization.
- **Capacitation of Sperm**: Occurs in the fallopian tubes.
- **Acrosome Reaction**:
  - Occurs after capacitation.
  - The acrosomal membrane of the capacitated sperm ruptures, releasing enzymes that dissolve the corona radiata and zona pellucida surrounding the oocyte.
- **Zona Pellucida Reaction**:
  - Occurs after the acrosome reaction.
  - Prevents other sperm from entering the oocyte.
  - Physiologically, double fertilization is not possible under normal circumstances.

## Implantation

- **Definition**: Approximately 6-7 days (1 week) post-fertilization, the embryo implants into the uterine lining, with a short window of opportunity.
- **Process of Implantation**: Localization, adhesion, invasion.
> **Leukocytes**: Recognition, adherence, degradation.
- **Conditions**:
  - Disappearance of the zona pellucida.
  - Syncytiotrophoblast (from the trophoblast of the blastocyst).
  - Synchronization between the blastocyst and the uterine lining.
  - Adequate levels of estrogen and progesterone in the pregnant woman.

> - **Capacitation Site**: Uterine cavity and fallopian tubes.
> - **Site of Fertilization**: Ampullary-isthmic junction of the fallopian tube.
> - **Ectopic Pregnancy Common Site**: Ampulla.
> - **Endometriosis Common Site**: Ovary > uterosacral ligament.

## Stages of Fetal Development

- **Pregnancy Weeks**: Calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period, hence 2 weeks need to be subtracted to determine the week of conception.
- **Calculation of Gestational Age**: From the first day of the last menstrual period.
- **Embryo**: Up to the end of the 10th week of gestation (10 weeks of pregnancy), or the end of the 8th week of fetal age. Differentiation and formation.
- **Fetus**: From the 11th week of gestation (11 weeks of pregnancy) or from the 9th week of fetal age. Growth and maturation.
- **Timeline** (all ages are fetal ages!):
  - **Embryo**: From fertilization to the 8th week of fetal age.
  - **Fetus**: From the 8th week of fetal age to birth.
    - **Preterm Infant**: 28 - 37 weeks.
    - **Term Infant**: 37 - 42 weeks.
    - **Post-term Infant**: Greater than 42 weeks.
  - **Infant**: From birth to 1 year.
    - **Newborn**: From birth to 4 weeks post-birth.
  - **Toddler**: 1 year to 3 years.
  - **Preschool Age**: 3 years to 6 years.
  - **School Age**: 6 years to 12 years.
  - **Adolescence**: 12 years to 18 years.

## Developmental Characteristics

- **4 weeks (28 days, one menstrual month)** is the unit of gestational age, totaling 280 days or 40 weeks.
- **8 weeks**: Heart forms, fetal movement visible on ultrasound.
- **12 weeks**: Gender can be recognized.
- **First Felt Fetal Movements**: Some at 16 weeks, generally at 20 weeks.
- **Heart Sounds Heard**: End of 20 weeks.
- **"First Five Square, Last Five Multiply"**
  - **First five months of fetal length**: \( L = m^2 \).
  - **Last five months of fetal length**: \( L = m \times 5 \).

## Anatomy

| Vascular Structure | Number | Clinical Significance |
|------------------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| Umbilical Arteries | 2      | Close postnatally as the round ligament of the liver. Assess fetal blood supply and placental function; changes in the S/D ratio may indicate intrauterine growth restriction or placental dysfunction. |
| Umbilical Vein    | 1      | Closes postnatally as the ligamentum teres. |
| Ductus Arteriosus | 1 (open prenatally, closes postnatally) | Allows blood flow from the pulmonary artery to the aorta during fetal life. Closes 2-3 months after birth. Abnormalities may lead to cardiac issues. |
| Foramen Ovale     | 1 (closes in most cases postnatally) | Allows blood flow between the right and left atria during pregnancy. Closes mostly by 6 weeks postnatally. Persistence may indicate congenital heart disease. |

- **Blood**:
  - Hematopoiesis begins in the yolk sac at 3 weeks of fetal age, followed by the liver, bone marrow, and spleen (Ref: Pediatrics).
  - Granulocytes appear in fetal blood at 8 weeks of gestation, lymphocytes in the thymus and spleen at 12 weeks.
- **Respiration**:
  - Thoracic wall movements visible on ultrasound at 11 weeks, breathing movements in amniotic fluid after 16 weeks.
- **Digestion**:
  - Intestinal peristalsis begins at 11 weeks, basic digestive system established by 16 weeks.
- **Urogenital**:
  - Urination occurs by 11-14 weeks, bladder contains urine by 14 weeks.
- **Endocrine**:
  - Thyroid and pancreas begin developing at 6 weeks, "Double" by 12 weeks: thyroid hormones and insulin.
- **Reproductive**:
  - Male: Testes: 9 weeks; Female: Ovaries: 11-12 weeks.
