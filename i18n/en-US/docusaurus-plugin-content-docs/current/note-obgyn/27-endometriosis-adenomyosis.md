# Endometriosis and Adenomyosis

> The main clinical distinction is that both conditions involve dysmenorrhea, but in endometriosis, the uterus is not enlarged and blue-violet nodules are present (not due to uterine enlargement itself), whereas in adenomyosis, there is uniform enlargement.

## Endometriosis

### Overview

- **Definition**: Endometriosis (EMT) is characterized by the presence of viable endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity and myometrium, typically elsewhere in the body.
- **Hormone-Dependent**: Benign in nature but exhibits malignant behaviors such as implantation, infiltration, metastasis, and recurrence.

### Histological Occurrence

- **Implantation Theory**.
- **Coelomic Epithelium Metaplasia Theory**.
- **Stem Cell Origin Theory**.

### Etiology and Influencing Factors

- **Genetics**.
- **Immune System**.
- **Estrogen**.
- **In Situ Endometrium Determinism** (unclear).

### Pathology

- **Can occur anywhere in the body**, but predominantly in the pelvis. The ovaries are most commonly affected, followed by the uterosacral ligaments and rectovaginal pouch.
- **Under the influence of estrogen**, repeated cyclical bleeding of ectopic endometrial tissue leads to the formation of purple-red or brown-yellow nodules.
- **Metaplasia and Neoplastic Transformation** can occur, leading to conditions like endometrioid adenocarcinoma and clear cell carcinoma.

### Clinical Presentation

- **Symptoms**:
  - Dysmenorrhea.
  - Infertility.
  - Dyspareunia.
  - Menstrual irregularities.
  - Acute abdominal pain.
- **Signs**:
  - Rupture of large ovarian endometriotic cysts can cause peritoneal irritation.
  - Rectal examination may reveal a retroverted fixed uterus, with painful nodules palpable in the rectovaginal pouch, uterosacral ligaments, and lower segment of the posterior uterine wall.

### Clinical Staging
**ASRM Staging:**

- [Score](https://www.asrm.org/globalassets/_rf/news-and-publications/bookletsfact-sheets/chinese-pdf/endometriosis-chinese.pdf)
- **Staging**:

| Stage | Description | Total Points         |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| I     | Minimal     | 1-5                  |
| II    | Mild        | 6-15                 |
| III   | Moderate    | 16-40                |
| IV    | Severe      | >40                  |

### Diagnosis

- **Suspicion**: Reproductive-age female + secondary dysmenorrhea progressively worsening + swelling not located in the uterus (combined with infertility, dyspareunia, etc.) + positive signs.
- **Auxiliary Tests**:
  - **Imaging**: Transvaginal or abdominal ultrasound is preferred.
  - **CA125**: Elevated in severe cases, but usually not exceeding 100 U/ml.
  - **Laparoscopy**: Best diagnostic method.
- **Definitive Diagnosis**: Pathology (biopsy during laparoscopy).

### Treatment

- **Symptomatic Relief**: NSAIDs to alleviate abdominal pain.
- **Medication**: To reduce the estrogen environment in the body.
  - **Oral Contraceptives**: "Pseudo-pregnancy therapy."
  - **Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH-a)**: (downregulation of receptors with long-term use) inhibits the secretion of pituitary gonadotropins.
- **Surgical Treatment**:
  - **Fertility-Preserving Surgery**: For younger patients.
  - **Ovarian Function-Preserving Surgery**: For patients under 45 years old.
  - **Radical Surgery**: For severely ill patients nearing menopause who are over 45 years old.
