## Peripheral Nervous System

### Cranial Nerves

- **Definition**: Cranial nerves are peripheral nerves connected to the brain.
- **Number**: 12 pairs.

### Olfactory Nerve (Olfactory Nerve, 1)

- **Origin**: Olfactory epithelium in the upper nasal cavity.
- Bipolar neurons pass through the cribriform plate into the anterior cranial fossa, terminating at the olfactory bulb, whose neurons send fibers through the olfactory tract to the olfactory center.
- Special visceral sensory fibers; sensory nerve conducting olfaction.
- **Localization Diagnosis**:
  - Nasal mucosa: Local lesions affecting both sides can cause decreased or absent sense of smell.
  - Olfactory nerve, bulb, and tract: Abnormalities (decreased or absent sense of smell); tumors in the frontal lobe or olfactory sulcus can cause unilateral or bilateral loss of smell.
  - Olfactory center: Lesions generally do not cause loss of smell but may cause olfactory disturbances (parosmia).

### Optic Nerve (Optic Nerve, 2)

- **Origin**: Axons of retinal ganglion cells.
- The retina has three layers of neurons:
  - Outermost: Rods and cones.
  - Middle: Bipolar cells.
  - Innermost: Retinal ganglion cells.
- Pathway: Ganglion cells → optic canal → middle cranial fossa → above the sella turcica forming the optic chiasm → nasal half fibers cross to the contralateral side, temporal half remains ipsilateral → form the optic tract → lateral geniculate nucleus → decussate → posterior limb of internal capsule → optic radiation → occipital visual cortex.
- **Localization Diagnosis**:

|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Optic nerve             | Unilateral blindness, direct pupillary reflex (-), consensual reflex (+)                                   | Optic neuritis, optic atrophy, tumor compression   |
| Optic chiasm            | Bitemporal hemianopia                                                                                      | Pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, aneurysm     |
| Optic tract             | Contralateral homonymous hemianopia in both eyes, direct pupillary reflex (-) on the affected side         | Stroke, brain tumor, head trauma                   |
| Optic radiation         | Upper quadrantanopia if damaged in the parietal lobe, lower quadrantanopia if damaged in the temporal lobe | Stroke, brain tumor, head trauma                   |
| Occipital visual center | Contralateral homonymous hemianopia, macular sparing, visual agnosia                                       | Occipital infarction, occipital tumor, head trauma |

### Oculomotor, Trochlear, and Abducens Nerves (Oculomotor Nerve, Trochlear Nerve, Abducens Nerve, 3, 4, 6)

- **Origins**:
  - Oculomotor: Oculomotor nucleus located below the aqueduct in the periaqueductal gray matter.
  - Trochlear: Originates from the trochlear nucleus in the inferior colliculus.
  - Abducens: Originates from the abducens nucleus in the midline of the pons.
- The oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves, through their innervated muscles, collectively control eye movements and various reflexes.
- **Localization Diagnosis**:
  - **Ocular Muscle Paralysis and Diplopia**:
    - **Causes**: When the oculomotor, trochlear, abducens nerves and their nuclei, or connecting fibers are diseased.
